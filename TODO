- RESTify application
- Fix layout to align menu and content blocks
- Make <Hx> elements respect logical levels (top is H1 etc.) and style them
  using CSS instead of selecting them by what "usually looks the right size" 
- Complete fattening of the Model classes with more business logic that
  shouldn't be in the controllers and unifying them to represent actual business
  objects rather than individual tables.
- Remove the rest of silly distinctions between PHP->Form and Form->PHP variable
  names f* and t*, if there should be any left by now.
- Decide whether to use whitespace-chomping TT tags (source looks better, more
  work) or aggressively chomp using TT options (smaller)
- Refactor the whole mess to smaller testable units
- Write more tests!
- Implement account creation/deletion hooks
- Properly support Postgres
  (http://www.chrisspen.com/blog/enabling-implicit-cast-from-integer-to-boolean-in-postgresql.html
  might help)
- Check templates for proper HTML entity filtering, there are probably still a
  lot of XSS-exploitable bugs.
