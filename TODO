- Remove Data::Dumper use
- RESTify application
- Fix layout to align menu and content blocks
- Make <Hx> elements respect logical levels (top is H1 etc.) and style them using CSS
  instead of selecting them by what "usually looks the right size" 
- Fatten the Model classes with more business logic that shouldn't be in the
  Controllers
- Remove silly distinction between PHP->Form and Form->PHP variable names f* and t*
- Decide whether to use whitespace-chomping TT tags (source looks better, more work)
  or aggressively chomp using TT options (smaller)
