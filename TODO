- Remove Data::Dumper use
- RESTify application
- Fix layout to align menu and content blocks
- Make <Hx> elements respect logical levels (top is H1 etc.) and style them using CSS
  instead of selecting them by what "usually looks the right size" 
- Fatten the Model classes with more business logic that shouldn't be in the
  Controllers and unify them to represent actual business objects rather than
  individual tables. This has been started in the "newmodel" branch already.
- Remove the rest of silly distinctions between PHP->Form and Form->PHP variable names
  f* and t*, if there should be any left by now.
- Decide whether to use whitespace-chomping TT tags (source looks better, more work)
  or aggressively chomp using TT options (smaller)
- Refactor the whole mess to smaller testable units
- Write more tests!
- Implement account creation/deletion hooks
- Properly support Postgres (http://www.chrisspen.com/blog/enabling-implicit-cast-from-integer-to-boolean-in-postgresql.html might help)
- Check templates for proper HTML entity filtering, there are probably still a
  lot of XSS-exploitable bugs.
