- Remove Data::Dumper use
- RESTify application
- Fix layout to align menu and content blocks
- Make <Hx> elements respect logical levels (top is H1 etc.) and style them using CSS
  instead of selecting them by what "usually looks the right size" 
- Fatten the Model classes with more business logic that shouldn't be in the
  Controllers and unify them to represent actual business objects rather than
  individual tables.
- Remove the rest of silly distinctions between PHP->Form and Form->PHP variable names
  f* and t*
- Decide whether to use whitespace-chomping TT tags (source looks better, more work)
  or aggressively chomp using TT options (smaller)
- Refactor the whole mess to smaller testable units
- Implement account creation/deletion hooks
- Properly support Postgres (http://www.chrisspen.com/blog/enabling-implicit-cast-from-integer-to-boolean-in-postgresql.html might help)
