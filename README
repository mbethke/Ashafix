This is a port of Postfixadmin to Perl/Mojolicious/TemplateToolkit. It aims to
be cleaner, following an MVC pattern and strict modularization throughout, thus
easier to extend and more secure. Most importantly it makes use of Perl's proper
DBMS support via DBIx::Simple and thus uses none of the all too common in PHP
way of interpolating inputs in SQL strings that gives you SQL injection
vulnerabilities unless your manual escaping is perfect.

This is very much a work in progress. Currently a lot of functionality is still
missing but basic functions such as creating/editing/deleting domains and
mailboxes are there.

Notes:

- Requires at least version 2.3 of the database, particularly regarding domain entries for global admins in the domainadmin table.
- The MySQL database uses InnoDB for transactions and referential integrity
  constraints. With databases this size, there is hardly any excuse for using
  MyISAM today.
- Postgres support is still broken but the above should simplify the task of
  getting it to work. I'm still thinking about going DBIx::Class to abstract it
  away.
