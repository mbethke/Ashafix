To start playing around with Ashafix, better don't use your production Postfix
database. Create a new one using the included schema:

- Create a new MySQL database and corresponding user to match the data in
  ashafix.conf. To work with the defaults:
  CREATE DATABASE postfix_new;
  GRANT select,insert,delete,update ON postfix_new.* TO 'postfixadmin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'pfadm';
  use postfix_new
  \. misc/newschema.sql

- There is no conversion script for old Postfixadmin databases yet. Just run the
  test script and use the data it leaves behind:
  $ TESTING=1 script/ashafix test
  Login is "test@test.invalid" with password "12345678".
